#Flashing the firmware

Flashing the firmware is the first thing you need to do before you start to communicate with you NodeMCU and upload the program files.

Before you can start flashing however you need to have the right tools installed in you computer.

The tools needed are python (a program language) and esptool (the flashing tool that is written in python)

Installing python (if you done this previously you can skip this step since it only needs to be done once):

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
sudo brew install python
sudo easy_install pip

Installing the Esptool:

sudo pip install esptool

Locate firmware file

cd path/to/github/folder

Flash:
esptool.py -p /dev/tty.wchusbserial1410 write_flash -fm dio -fs 32m 0x00000 nodemcu-master-21-modules-2016-07-11-12-51-01-float.bin
